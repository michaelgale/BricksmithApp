/*
 *
 * LDrawBDP - A Big Dumb Pool of memory - THEORY OF OPERATION
 *
 * The BDP allocator is a non-thread-safe high-speed allocator
 * with peculiar semantics:
 *
 * - Memory allocations are not explicitly freed by app code.  Instead all
 *  allocations persist until the pool itself is destroyed.
 *
 * This special rule has some implications:
 *
 * - Allocations are very fast and efficient even for small allocations,
 *  because there is no book-keeping for individual blocks.
 *
 * - Consecutive allocations have good locality because the pool
 *  subdivides larger blocks, rather than scavanging free memory.
 *  Consecutive allocations are consecutive in memory _most_ of
 *  the time.  (This makes linked lists significantly less expensive
 *  to traverse.)
 *
 * - Overall consumption is higher both due to pool large-chunk
 *  allocations, the no-free policy, and wasted space in the larger
 *  chunks.
 *
 * The BDP allocator is useful in cases where we need to piece
 * together data structures for a specific task and can dump the
 * whole pool when done.
