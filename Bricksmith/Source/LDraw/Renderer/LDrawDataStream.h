/*
 * The LDrawDataStream is an experimental implementation of Rob Barris'
 * ideas on OpenGL vertex streaming: unlike a standard "orphan" VBO
 * (where we buffer null to get a new buffer, map it, write data, unmap,
 * use it) the stream works by windowing one large buffer: we map
 * asynchronously, write part, flush part, use part, and then move down
 * the buffer.
 *
 * For many very small draw calls, this saves us the overhead
 * of orphaning very small buffers (which the VBO doesn't cope with well).
 *
 * When the stream is mapped, we get a base ptr to write data into.
 * When it is umapped, we get a base ptr relative to the VBO, and the VBO is
 * made current for setting up glVertexAttribPointer.
