// Model Manager terminology:
//
// Documents "sign in" and "sign out" with the model manager when they first are
// opened or receive their path.  The document uses its LDrawFile * as its
// identifier.
//
// A signed in document can then request a model based on its "part name" (which
// is really just the file name in its home directory).  The file is loaded
// and retained by the model manager until the document signs out.
//
// If a requested model changes (e.g. the user opens the requested model and
// thus the existing LDrawFile is thrown out in favor of the one that the user
// opened) then the client part will receive a notification that its model is
// going away, and the next call to requestModel will return the new correct
// model.
