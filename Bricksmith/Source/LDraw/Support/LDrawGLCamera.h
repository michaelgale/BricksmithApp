///			    Things appkit knows about:
///
///			    Scroll position
///				   owned by the camera.
///
///			    Zoom
///				   owned by camera.
///
///			    Document Size - a fiction that could be used to represent scroll bar positions
///				   owned by camera
///
///			    Viewport (View) Size
///				   owned by AppKit
///				   camera must be told
///
///			    Things OpenGL knows about:
///				   viewport - always set to visible area of GL drawable by view code - the camera assumes this is true.
///				   transform matrices - always owned by camera.
///
///				The coordinate system is rather weird.
///
///				At zoom=100% (1.0), one point on the screen is equal to one
///             LDrawUnit (model unit) in an orthographic projection. In a
///             perspective projection, the equivalence is maintained at the
///             model origin.
///
///				Scrolling occurs by sliding the visible rect around an infinite
///             plane. The coordinate system origin is that of a rectangle with
///             size of the viewport, whose *center* is on the model origin. At
///             100% zoom, the size of the visible rect is the same as the
///             viewport. It is scaled according to the zoom factor.
