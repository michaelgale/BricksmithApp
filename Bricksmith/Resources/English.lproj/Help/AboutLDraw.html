		<!-- Content -->
		<p>
		The Lego bricks you use in Bricksmith come from a part library called 
		LDraw, maintained by Lego hobbyists  around the world. Their effort is 
		hosted on the Internet at <a href="http://www.ldraw.org">www.ldraw.org</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		<img src="images/LDrawLogo.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 12pt">
		Periodically, LDraw.org releases more official parts. But sometimes, the 
		part you need hasn't been included in an official release yet—either 
		because the part was only recently finished, or because the part is 
		still being perfected before it is certified for official release. In 
		either case, you can still use the parts today. You just have to 
		download and install them. 
		</p>

		<!-- Official Parts -->

		<h3>New Official Parts</h3>
		
		<p>
		Official Parts have been fully certified by LDraw and released in a part 
		update package to the library. Part updates are listed 
		<a href="http://www.ldraw.org/Topic26.html">here</a>, but I don't recommend 
		downloading them that way. Here's the easier route:
		</p>
		
		<h4>Download and Install</h4>

		<ol>
			<li>
			Download the <a href="http://www.ldraw.org/Downloads-req-getit-lid-98.html">newest complete LDraw library</a>. 
			</li>

			<li>
			Drag the old LDraw folder that came with Bricksmith to the trash. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
			Move the new LDraw folder you downloaded to the place where the old folder was. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>Making Your New Parts Appear in Bricksmith's Part Browser</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Bricksmith > Preferences.</li>
				<li>Select the Parts tab.</li>
				<li>Click "Reload Parts" in the LDraw Folder section.</li>
			</ol>

		<!-- Unofficial Parts -->
		
		<h3>New Unofficial Parts</h3>
		
		<p>
		Unofficial parts haven't been released in an official part update yet, 
		either because they aren't certified perfect yet, or because they are 
		queued up waiting for the next official update. There are two ways to 
		download unofficial parts: 
			<ul>
				<li>The Easy Way (everything at once)</li>
				<li>The Hard Way (one part at a time.)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h4>The Easy Way (everything at once)</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="http://www.ldraw.org/library/unofficial/ldrawunf.zip">Download the complete archive</a> of parts in the tracker.</li>
				<li>
					Rename the downloaded folder "ldrawunf" to "Unofficial"
				</li>
				<li>
					Move the folder to LDraw/Unofficial
				</li>
				<li>Follow steps under "Making Your New Parts Appear in Bricksmith's Part Browser" above.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
		Note: there are a few applications (notably L3P) which don't recognize 
		parts in LDraw/Unofficial. Should you encounter one, you'll have to 
		manually merge the files into the main LDraw folder. <strong>Do not 
		accidentally overwrite nested folders</strong> such as PARTS/S or P/48. 
		</p>
		
		<h4>The Hard Way (One part at a time.)</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Look up the part number you need (it's usually 
		molded on the bottom of the Lego brick somewhere)</li>
				<li>Search for it on the <a href="http://www.ldraw.org/library/tracker/">LDraw Part Tracker</a>.</li>
				<li>Download it and copy it to LDraw/Unofficial/parts</li>
				<li>Check for any listed dependencies or subparts.</li>
				<li>Download them. The website will tell you where they go; usually it's LDraw/Unofficial/P.</li>
				<li>Repeat as needed until you have no more subparts to download. Note that subparts can require other subparts.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

			If you use unofficial parts and want to share your creations with others,
			they must also install the unofficial parts you used.
