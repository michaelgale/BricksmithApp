		<h2>
		Rotating Steps
		</h2>
		
		<p>
		Sometimes, you may find that you need to show the underside of your 
		model, such as when putting wheels on the bottom of a car chassis. Or 
		perhaps you need to rotate it to see the other side. You can do this 
		with the Step Rotation settings. 
		</p>

		<div id="notebox">
			You will only see step rotations applied when Step Display is 
			active. 
		</div>

		<p>
		There are several different ways to enter a step rotation. Ultimately 
		they all do the same thing: rotate your model. But some types of 
		rotations are easier to accomplish in one mode than in another.

						the default 3D perspective angle, then adding the value 
						you specify. This setting is ideal for most normal 
						step-rotation operations, such as flipping upside-down 
						or looking at the left or right side of the model.

						Whatever you type in, that’s what the camera angle is. 
						This is perfect for setting a view like Top, but 
						otherwise it should be avoided in favor of Relative 
						rotation. While it may be tempting to use Absolute 
						rotation for everything, your instructions will look 
						better (and more consistent) if you always base your 
						rotation on the default viewing angle like relative mode 
						does.

						y=90° additive step rotations would show all four sides 
						of the model in order. In contrast, each Relative

						so they cannot accumulate.
