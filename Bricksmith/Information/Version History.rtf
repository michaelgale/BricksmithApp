\f0\fs24 \cf0 Version History:\
\

\b Bricksmith 3.1:\

\b0 Filter colors by material\
\'93Goto model\'94 opens referenced LDR files and switches submodes based on selection.\
\'93Change origin\'94 moves all parts in a sub-model and corrects changes where used.\
\'93Split Model\'94 copies a sub-model into the parent so individual bricks can be edited.\
\'93Add Model from Selection\'94 turns the selection into  sub-model and inserts it.\
Parts can be nudged and oriented along their own axis based on their current orientation.\

\b \
Bricksmith 3.0:\

\b0 Use selection for spin center\
Fixed modifier shortcuts for mouse tools after invoking a contextual menu on 10.8 (caused by an undocumented Apple category method overwriting mine!)\
Curved parts are drawn with smooth shading\
Translucent parts correctly show the model behind them. (The interiors of translucent parts may not be rendered correctly.)\
Performance improvements for rendering models with large numbers of parts.\
"Insert Related" command automatically inserts selected parts that match the selection, e.g. drawers for a cupboard, tires for a wheel, window glass for a window frame.\
"Walk-Through" camera mode lets you view your model from the inside.\
LSynth integration\
Search panel\

\b \
Bricksmith 2.6.1:\

\b0 Auto-update mechanism\
Fixed texture path lookup\
Fixed texture drag handles getting textured\
Fixed object selection within textures\
Moved Legonian ruler into app bundle
\b \
\
Bricksmith 2.6:\

\b0 Pan-dragging is not affected by perspective distortion\
Zooming gesture locked in when view is orthographic; no interspersed rotations are permitted (prevents view from changing to perspective)\
Allow leading whitespace in any line.\

\cf0 New duplicated parts are inserted into last step instead of current one.\
Option-wheel to zoom.\
Command-Shift-C for color palette\
Removed nonstandard Officiality setting for models\
Parses and searches !KEYWORDS\
Source-list UI for part browser\
Part Browser search scope buttons for choosing all parts or selected category\
Speed improvements for submodel lookup\
Drag a rectangle outside a part (when rotation is disabled) to select multiple parts.\
Step display won't change the view rotation unless the step specifies it\
Identify and categorize alias parts, and exclude them from searches\
Fix crash on 10.7+ when closing windows or viewports\
TEXMAP PLANAR support\
Fix primitives failing to be drawn in new submodels\
Fix hangs when leaving a field editing and uncommitted in the inspector, then deleting the part out from underneath\
Fix intermittent exception on file loading\
Rotation can be set to turntable-style as well as track-ball.  With turntable rotation, the model never rolls onto its side.\
Preferences to map the mouse wheel to zoom and right button to rotation.\
Neighbor file models are drawn including their MPD sub-model parts.\
Neighbor file models can be opened as documents and edited; changes are seen in the parent document.\

\b Bricksmith 2.4:\

\b0 64-bit\
Viewports fill their entire area (always correctly now, unlike last time I had that feature)\
Focus rings are drawn by Cocoa, so they look much nicer. They can also be drawn independently of the frame, elimitating extra redraws when tabbing between views.\
Eliminated extra redraws when clicking but not actually changing the selection.\
Mind-boggling speed improvements from recursively flattening part references.\
Fixed bounding-box transforms, which in turn fixed part selection for certain objects\
Supports RGB color syntax\
Traditional-style LDraw output\

\b \
Bricksmith 2.3:\

\b0 Zoom to Fit\
5% faster (by not doing four-way lighting)\
Configurable viewport arrangements\
Views stay scrolled to the center as they change size\
Selecting a part in step display no longer resets the viewing angle\
Reordering or copying steps does not clear the rotation settings\
\

\b Bricksmith 2.2:\

\b0 Middle mouse button activates spin mode\
Supports MacBook trackpad gestures\
Pen tablet eraser deletes parts\
Won't have problems with references to empty submodels\
Won't add "copy X" suffix when reordering models within a file\
Won't zoom to 0%\

\cf0 Part favorites\
Center-click/smooth zoom in Perspective views actually centers the model\
